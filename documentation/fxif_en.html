<h1>What&rsquo;s it</h1>
<p>FxIF (Firefox exIF) allows you to view meta information data contained in JPEG images from the convenience of your Firefox browser. Most digital cameras add EXIF data to all images you take and much editing software adds or allows you to add more informations on the picture and you the creator.</p>
<p>FxIF is written entirely in JavaScript, and as such should be portable to all platforms that Mozilla runs on.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>After installing FxIF, simply right click on an image, then click <code>Properties</code>. The meta data will be displayed in the properties window. This integration into the existing dialog keeps the interface simple.</p>

<h1>In detail</h1>

<h2>What can it display</h2>
<p>Meta data that&rsquo;s contained in JPEG image files in three
forms:</p>
<ul>
	<li>binary EXIF data. This is added by most cameras automatically and contains technical informations on the camera model and manufacturer, date and time the image was taken, aperture and shutter speed used, focal length and much much more.</li>
	<li>IPTC-NAA data in a binary structure (IIM). IPTC-NAA comprises a standardized set of fields focusing on informations as the name of the photographer, caption and title for the image, copyright informations, keywords a.s.o.</li>
	<li>XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform). In contrast to aforementioned this data isn&rsquo;t stored binary but as an XML document within the image and isn&rsquo;t restricted to only camera or image informations but can hold both and even more. It&rsquo;s developed by Adobe and pushed by their applications including Photoshop. As said, XMP can hold various informations as all the EXIF data mentioned above and also those from IPTC-NAA as well as application specific.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its advantage is the use of UTF-8 encoding&ndash;so data can be added in every language available&ndash;and also the possibility to hold an information in more than one language simultaneously.</p>
<p>Out of the camera most images will only contain binary EXIF data but this may change in future and there&rsquo;s much software to add the other informations by you. And software like Photoshop will at least duplicate the EXIF information into XMP data and add data of its own to your image if you just save it&ndash;or at least if you don&rsquo;t do <em>Save for Web</em>.</p>

<h2>And which fields in detail?</h2>
<p>In detail you can view the following EXIF fields: ImageDescription, Make, Model, Orientation, ModifyDate/DateTimeOriginal/DateTimeDigitized, Artist, Copyright, ExposureTime., FNumber, ExposureProgram, GPSInfo, ISO, ShutterSpeedValue, ExposureCompensation, MaxApertureValue, SubjectDistance, MeteringMode, LightSource, Flash, FocalLength, UserComment, ExifImageWidth, ExifImageLength, FocalPlaneXResolution, FocalPlaneResolutionUnit. ExposureMode, WhiteBalance, DigitalZoomRatio, FocalLengthIn35mmFormat</p>
<p>Also following fields are taken from IPTC-NAA: By-line, Caption-Abstract, Headline, CopyrightNotice</p>
<p>And the following from XMP: dc:Creator, photoshop:Headline, dc:Description, dc:Rights</p>
<p>That said, not all data is displayed always and at once. First not all files contain all fields. And second if fields that exist to hold the same information like the photographers name or description of the image are present in more than one structure, the information is only displayed once. The priority in which they&rsquo;re used is XMP, IPTC-NAA, EXIF in descending order.</p>
<p>Also for your convenience if GPS coordinates are available in the EXIF fields, a weblink to a map provider is displayed behind them. At least it is in Firefox 3 and SeaMonkey 2 because earlier don&rsquo;t support the technique used.</p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s not that much, why not more?</h2>
<p>FxIF wants to give you the informations which most people most likely want to see when viewing an image in the browser. That is a quick look when, by which camera with which settings, where and some informations on the subject.</p>
<p>There are other applications that give you any possible information found in the image. But from our point of view their purpose is different and doesn&rsquo;t make much sense in the browser.</p>

<h2>And why only in JPEG images?</h2>
<p>That image format is by far the most common and concentrating on it keeps the extension simple.</p>
<h2>Where is it supposed to run on</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier it&rsquo;s written in JavaScript and XUL, so it should run in combination with the GRE (Gecko Runtime Environment) everywhere GRE runs.</p>
<p>Out of the box the extension is made for the Firefox browser from version 0.10 on, the Mozilla Application suite from version 1.7 on and its successor SeaMonkey from version 1.0 on.</p>

<h2>What does it cost?</h2>
<p>Nothing. It&rsquo;s free software in terms of the Free Software Foundations. It&rsquo;s triple licensed as MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, LGPL 2.1 and like most extensions for the Mozilla platform comes with the source code in the XPI file itself.</p>

<h1>Configure me</h1>
<p>Since likings are different we decided to make two functions configurable. You can do this via the options dialog on the Add-On manager (available in Firefox and SeaMonkey 2) or by directly manipulating the respective pref.</p>
<p>First option is to choose the format used for displaying coordinates. This is either Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) like 40&deg;&nbsp;43&prime;&nbsp;20.7&Prime;&nbsp;N, 74&deg;&nbsp;02&prime;&nbsp;47.2&Prime;&nbsp;W or decimal degree (DD) like 40.722417&deg;&nbsp;N, 74.046444&deg;&nbsp;W. Any informations are rounded to two decimal places in DMS and six decimal places in DD format. The associated pref is <code>extensions.fxif.gpsFormat</code> where 0 means DMS and 1 DD.</p>
<p>The other option is the map provider to use for the weblink. The default (when the pref isn&rsquo;t available or empty) is to use <code>maps.google.com</code>, but as I wrote, likings are different.</p>
<p>So to change it, insert any URL into the field (or pref). You can use really any URL, but to have the respective coordinates used, put a <code>%lat%</code> anywhere the latitude shall be inserted and <code>%lon%</code> anywhere the longitude shall be inserted.</p>
<p>So the default is</p>
<p><code>http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=%lat%,%lon%&amp;q=%lat%,%lon%&amp;z=10&amp;hl=%lang%</code></p>
<p>but if you want to use Yahoo as a map provider, insert for example</p>
<p><code>http://maps.yahoo.com/index.php#mvt=m&amp;trf=0&amp;lon=%lon%&amp;lat=%lat%&amp;mag=8</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>http://atlas.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&amp;formtype=latlong&amp;latlongtype=decimal&amp;latitude=%lat%&amp;longitude=%lon%</code></p>
<p>for MapQuest a.s.o. In URL langitude and longitude will always get inserted in unrounded decimal format.</p>
<p>Noticed the <code>%lang%</code> in the Google Maps URL?This is the third placeholder available and will be replaced by the content language code you&rsquo;ve chosen in your general browser settings. It&rsquo;s not necessary but at least in case of Google offers the site in your language.</p>
<p>The associated pref is <code>extensions.fxif.mapProvider</code>.</p>

<h1>Are there localized versions?</h1>
<p>FxIF is already available in Chinese (Chinese and Taiwanese variants), Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Polish. The one used depends on the browsers locale. If you don&rsquo;t find your language in the list, you’re welcome to do a translation and donate it. You can get the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fxif/source/browse/trunk/locale/en-US">english version .dtd and .properties files</a> from the FxIF repository and mail us the tranlated file for inclusion.</p>

<h1>When will the next version get released?</h1>
<p>Like most projects &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s done&rdquo;. Since 0.23 the FxIF code has its <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fxif/">home at Google Code</a> and the source kept online can be <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fxif/source/checkout">checked out via svn</a>.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s new in 0.30</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Displaying of GPS coordinates</li>
	<li>Decoding of IPTC-NAA and XMP data</li>
	<li>Decoding of creator, title, description and copyright</li>
	<li>Ability to operate on images opened from mailbox, news and imap</li>
